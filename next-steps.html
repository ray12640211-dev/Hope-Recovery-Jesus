      <h2>Armor Up for Spiritual Warfare</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        The Christian life is not passive. Scripture teaches we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
        spiritual forces of darkness. God provides armor so you can stand firm.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.”
        — Ephesians 6:11

      <h2>Deny Self and Follow Jesus Daily</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Following Christ is surrender. It is not self-help. It is a new life where Jesus is Lord, not self.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “And whoever does not bear his cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple.”
        — Luke 14:27

      <p class="muted">
        We are saved by grace through faith (not works), but obedience is the fruit of a true walk with Christ.
      </p>

        “If you love Me, keep My commandments.”

      <h2>Live for God — Not Self</h2>
      <blockquote>
        “I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which
        I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.”
